# A2A Protocol Implementation Based on Java Spring Framework

## Project Overview
This project is an implementation of the A2A protocol based on the Java Spring framework. The A2A protocol aims to achieve interoperability between agents. Based on the principles of Google's A2A project, this project provides an out-of-the-box agent interaction solution on top of the Spring AI framework, and implements a frontend interface for convenient multi-agent management and tuning.

## Project Requirements
### Development Environment
- **JDK**: JDK 17 or above

### Reference Links
- [A2A Protocol Introduction](https://developers.googleblog.com/zh-hans/a2a-a-new-era-of-agent-interoperability/)
- [Google A2A GitHub](https://github.com/google/A2A)
- [Spring AI](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai)
- [The front-end project used by this project](https://github.com/MusaeMotion/A2A-manage-front-react)

## A2A Protocol Architecture and Corresponding Modules
![A2A Protocol Architecture](a2a.png)

### Module Mapping
- **A2A Client**: Corresponds to `framework/a2a-agent-client`, responsible for communicating with the A2A Server, encapsulating network requests, message processing, and other basic functions.
- **A2A Server**: Corresponds to `framework/a2a-agent-server`, handles client requests and provides agent services.
- **HostAgent and Remote Agent**: Corresponds to `framework/a2a-host-agent`, implements agent management and scheduling. It manages and maintains agent states, processes client requests, and assigns them to appropriate agents.
- **Front-End**: See the accompanying frontend screenshots for an intuitive user interface.[A2A-manage-front](https://github.com/MusaeMotion/A2A-manage-front-react)

## üí° Detailed Module Introduction

### A2A Root Project
- **agent-client-multiple-web**: HostAgent based on Spring AI and Spring Boot WebServer, corresponding to the original A2A project's `/samples/python/hosts/multiagent`. This module provides a web interface for multi-agent interaction, allowing users to interact with agents via a browser. After starting this module, visit `http://localhost:8080` to access the interface.
- **agent-client-single-cli**: SimpleAgent command-line DEMO based on Spring AI and Spring Boot, corresponding to the original A2A project's `/samples/python/hosts/cli`. Users can interact with agents via the command line, suitable for quick testing and development. Start the program by running `java -jar agent-client-single-cli.jar` in the command line and follow the prompts.
- **agent-server-ollama-sentiment-analysis**: Sentiment Analysis Agent A2A Server, a remote agent DEMO implemented with Spring AI and Spring Boot.
- **agent-server-ollama-vision**: Vision Recognition Agent A2A Server, a remote agent DEMO implemented with Spring AI and Spring Boot.
- **agent-server-zhipu-generate-images**: Zhipu Text-to-Image Agent A2A Server, a remote agent DEMO implemented with Spring AI and Spring Boot.

### framework Directory
- **a2a-agent-client**: A2A protocol client middleware, providing basic communication functions for client modules, encapsulating network requests, message processing, etc.
- **a2a-agent-server**: Middleware referenced by the A2A Server project, providing common services and tools for server modules.
- **a2a-common**: Common module, containing classes, utility methods, and constants shared by multiple modules in the project.
- **a2a-host-agent**: HostAgent implementation, responsible for managing and scheduling agents, processing client requests, and assigning them to appropriate agents. This module implements agent registration, list query, deletion, and other functions to ensure efficient agent management.
- **agent-core**: Supports HostAgent, implemented based on Spring AI. Provides core agent functions such as message processing, state management, and tool invocation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Building and Startup
### Project Building
The project uses Maven for building. Execute the following command in the project root directory:
```bash
mvn clean install
```

### Project Startup
1. Start the Spring Boot project beginning with "agent - server" (the agent project).
2. Start the "agent - client - multiple - web" project.
3. Start the supporting frontend project.
4. Register on the frontend management backend by filling in the agent address.

# Microservice Implementation Plan
1. Use **Spring Cloud Gateway** as the unified gateway to accept requests from two sources:
    - End-user frontend.
    - `host-agent`.

2. Use **Nacos** as the service registry (all microservice agents, the gateway, and `host-agent` register here).

> ### ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
> 1. This project only provides a simplified demo. Nacos-related configuration and account setup are **outside the scope**; please refer to the official documentation to start and configure Nacos.
>
> 2. **Startup Order**  
     >    Because `agent-client-nacos-gateway` reads the Nacos service list immediately on startup, **start all microservice agents and `agent-client-multiple-web` (`host-agent`) first**, then **start `agent-client-nacos-gateway` last**.  
     >    The gateway automatically performs three tasks:
     >    - Retrieves the agent list and dynamically builds routes for remote agents (accessible by `host-agent`).
     >    - Dynamically builds routes for `host-agent` (accessible by nginx or other callers).
>    - After route construction, automatically registers all microservice agents to `host-agent`, eliminating manual registration and unifying the access path.
>
> 3. `agent-client-multiple-web` (`host-agent`) is not designed as a microservice by default; cross-origin settings exist in the `WebMvcConfig` class. If accessed via the unified gateway, **comment out the CORS code** to prevent conflicts with gateway-level CORS configuration.
>
> 4. To support dynamic route building, this demo enforces a naming convention:
     >    - Remote agents must use prefix `agent-`.
     >    - `host-agent` must use prefix `host-`.
>
> 5. The gateway **dynamically rewrites** the agent‚Äôs `card-url` value. It updates the configuration in the config center under **DataId = service-name.yaml**, so every agent should set `file-extension: yaml` in its Nacos configuration.
>
> 6. **Quick Demo Checklist**
     >    - Start `agent-server-nacos-fiction`.
     >    - Start `agent-client-multiple-web` (**remember to disable CORS**).
>    - Start `agent-client-nacos-gateway`.
>    - Update the frontend `.env` file:
       >      ```
>      UMI_APP_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:10000 ```
